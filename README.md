# Hangman Project

Created as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

### Functionality

Basic hangman game. 12 guesses to find the answer through the command line. The user has the option at the beginning to start a new game or to load a saved game. The user can also save a game in progress.

### Thoughts

This was my first project using file I/O and serialization without a guided tutorial. The assignment mentioned serializing classes, which saved me a lot of time digging into other avenues of saving the game progress. 

I took almost all of Ruby Cop's suggestions for syntax, though not all.
